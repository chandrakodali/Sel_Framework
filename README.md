## Key Features  
1. **Data-Driven Testing**:  
   - Developed an Excel Utility to manage test data dynamically, supporting parameterized testing and improving coverage.  

2. **Page Object Model (POM)**:  
   - Enhanced maintainability and modularity by separating UI elements and test logic into reusable components.  

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**:  
   - Supports parallel execution on multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.  

4. **Advanced Mouse and Keyboard Automation**:  
   - Integrated Selenium WebDriver with the Robot Class to perform advanced interactions and screen captures.  

5. **Parallel and Multithreaded Execution**:  
   - XML-driven configurations enable concurrent test execution to reduce runtime.  

6. **Reporting with ExtentReports**:  
   - Generates detailed, interactive HTML reports with test results, steps, and failure details.  

7. **CI/CD Integration**:  
   - Configured GitHub Actions for automated test execution and reporting.  

8. **Zephyr Scale Integration**:  
   - Automatically updates test results in Jira, enabling seamless traceability.  

9. **Client-Specific Execution**:  
   - Validated functionality on the clientâ€™s VDI environment for compatibility.
